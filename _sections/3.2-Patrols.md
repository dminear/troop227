title: "Patrols"

- Patrol Method:  The Troop is organized into 4 Patrols (Moose, Raccoon, Wolverine, and Buffalo), which work together as a team.  Each Patrol elects a leader and an assistant.  We do not segregate the patrols by age or tenure in the Troop.  We expect the older Scouts to help teach the younger Scouts on the proper way to do things (with the assistance of the Adult leadership).  The Patrol method is the best method to allow the Scouts to learn how to organize themselves, work together, and learn leadership and organizational skills.
