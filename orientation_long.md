# Troop 227, Huntington Beach

## Troop History

- Continuous operations for 47 years, since 1970
- Sponsored by Men's Club of St. Bonaventure Catholic Church 
- Quality Unit awards 2007-2016
- 40+ Eagle Scouts in last 10 years

## Program and Emphasis

- Meetings:  The Troop meets almost every Wednesday night at St Bonaventure.  Meetings start at 7:00 PM and end at approximately 8:30 PM.
- Scout Run Troop:  We are a Scout Run Troop.  The Scouts select their activities, plan how they will do them, plan & organize their activities, and perform them.  Adults support the Scouts with logistics and transportation and oversight of their activities.  We have 2 annual planning meetings in August where the Scouts select their activities, and the Adults organize to support the Scout activities.
- Patrol Method:  The Troop is organized into 4 Patrols (Moose, Raccoon, Wolverine, and Buffalo), which work together as a team.  Each Patrol elects a leader and an assistant.  We do not segregate the patrols by age or tenure in the Troop.  We expect the older Scouts to help teach the younger Scouts on the proper way to do things (with the assistance of the Adult leadership).  The Patrol method is the best method to allow the Scouts to learn how to organize themselves, work together, and learn leadership and organizational skills.
- Scout Leadership:  The Scouts elect their senior Scout leadership (SPL, ASPLs, Troop Guide, etc.) who are responsible for organizing and running the meetings and activities.  Scout leadership is elected every December and June for the Troop offices which start 1 January and 1 July.
- Troop Organization:  The Troop is organized into Patrols, and the Patrols elect their leadership.  Overall leadership is done by the Senior Patrol Leader (SPL) with his 2 elected Assistants (ASPLs).  Other Elected Scouts support the SPL and ASPLs.  Elected Scouts, led by the Senior Patrol Leader (SPL) and his assistants hold a Patrol Leaders Council meeting every 4-8 weeks, where they plan and organize specific activities for meetings, outings, and other activities.  All Scouts and Adults are invited to the Patrol Leader Council meetings.
- Outdoor Activities:  We provide the Scouts with a variety of outdoor experiences and opportunities for learning and growth.  We have monthly outings, plus a weeklong summer camp each year.  These include camping in cold weather, the mountains, the deserts (where it may be quite hot), backpacking or at the beach.  Summer Camp is chosen by the Troop at a variety of Scout camps in California. Our goal is to provide a well-rounded experience for the Scouts in a variety of environments. Please see our Calendar for our current planned events.
- Advancement & Learning:  We do advancement at every meeting and on every outing.  We will not force a Scout to earn advancement but we will make available every opportunity for him to achieve these.  We typically have an annual advancement day in a local park to focus on advancement activities for the Scouts.
- Service to the Community:  We provide multiple opportunities for the Scouts to perform service to the Huntington Beach and Orange County community.  These range from supporting community organizations as a volunteer at special events, to service projects for local schools and community organizations, and to support our sponsoring organization.

## Attendance and Expectations:

- We expect the Scouts to regularly attend Troop meetings, in proper uniform.  If there are reasons that the Scout cannot attend meetings for a period (such as a seasonal athletics commitment or otherwise) please let us know.  We expect the Scout to be active in the Troop, and support meetings, outings and activities.  This expectation is emphasized for any elected Scout leadership position. 
- We expect the Scouts to follow the Scout Law and the Scout Oath in all their activities.  We expect the Scouts to behave appropriately in their conduct at all times on Scout activities. 
- We expect the Scouts to follow the Troop electronics policy.  Basically we expect the Scouts to be participating in meetings and activities in a Scoutly manner, and not playing with electronic devices.  If we are aware they are not doing this, we will confiscate the device and return it to the parent.  We take no responsibility for electronics on outings. 

## Parent Participation

- Parental support is very important for the Scouts.  We expect the parents to support and encourage their Scout's participation in both advancement and outings.  
- Our Troop operates with all the Parents as members of the Troop Committee.  The committee meets with the Scout Leadership approximately every other month, and approves expenditures, detailed planning and oversees Troop operations.  All parents are invited to attend the Leadership/ Parent (Troop Committee) meetings.
- Parents are encouraged to do what they can to support the Troop.  The Troop offers many ways for the Parents to be involved in the Scouting program and the Troop.  This can be as simple as supporting fundraisers or providing transportation of the Scout to meetings and activities.  Parents can also volunteer to help organize outings, the Courts of Honor, or other Troop activities.  We are an organization of volunteers and we are always looking to add more volunteers for our activities. 

## Training:

- We encourage parents and Scouts to participate in the many training activities available through the Scouting program, and other venues.  We require Adult leaders of activities to have the appropriate required training -- Youth Protection Training and Severe Weather are training required to lead any activities (this is a National Scouting requirement).  We encourage Adults to participate in the differing training opportunities for Scout Leader, Committee operations, and Outdoor Leadership in order to have a strong cadre of trained Adult leaders to support the Troop's operations.  We also have a cadre of adults who comply with the Catholic Church's Safe Environment program, to allow us to have meetings at St Bonaventure. 
- We hold a minimum of one annual Youth Leader Training for the Scout Leadership of the Troop.  This is an all day training program focusing on basic management and leadership skills for Boy Scouting and is organized and run by the Troop.

## Administration, Fees and Communications

- Dues are $180 for every Scout, each year.  Adult registration (needed to be a registered Adult Leader) is $38 each year.  We typically collect these fees in November to support recharter and re-registration.  
- We operate on a non-profit basis, so dues are used for recharter, Boys Life, Troop Insurance, Troop Equipment (tents, stoves, propane, Patrol boxes, cooking equipment, etc.) and recognition of advancement.  Scouts joining the Troop are provided a Scout Handbook, Troop neckerchief, neckerchief slide, green shoulder tabs, and a Troop number patch.  Scouts are expected to provide their own uniform and personal camping equipment (See Camping equipment checklist). 
- Troop outings are organized and paid for by the Scouts and Adults which attend the outing.  Typically these run $30-50 for a weekend outing, depending upon the venue.  If the Scouts support fundraising (such as the annual Popcorn sale) all the funds earned by the Scout are recorded in their Troop Account and can be used to pay for Scouting activities.  
- Medical forms and clearances:  Following the guidelines from the BSA National Office, we require an annual Health and Medical Record Form for every Scout and Adult.  If the Scout does not attend summer camp, we need a medical history and release form before any campouts.  If the Scout attends summer camp, they need an annual physical. (Adults need the same).  If the Scout has any medical conditions such as allergies or other conditions that can affect them on an outing we MUST know this.  Any medications (including non prescription ones) must be checked in with the Adult leader on the Trip, and not held by the Scout.  
- We maintain a current Troop Roster, which is updated and distributed several times a year.  Our primary means of communications is through an email list maintained by a parent volunteer (email addresses are part of the roster).  If anyone does not want their name or phone number to be listed in the roster, please let us know, but we must have current information to register the Scout in the Troop records. 
- We also maintain a Troop Web site at www.troop227.org which includes pictures of recent scouting activities and a calendar of upcoming events.
