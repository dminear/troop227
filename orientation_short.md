## Program and Emphasis

- Meetings:  The Troop meets almost every Wednesday night at St Bonaventure church at the corner of Springdale and Heil.  Meetings start at 7:00 PM and end at approximately 8:30 PM.  
- Scout Run Troop:   We are a Scout Run Troop.  The Scouts elect their leaders every 6 months. The Scouts select their activities, plan how they will do them, plan & organize their activities, and perform them.   Adults support the Scouts with logistics and transportation and oversight of their activities.  We have a fully trained Adult Scoutmaster, Assistant Scoutmasters, and Committee Chair.  
- Outdoor Activities:   We provide the Scouts with a variety of outdoor experiences and opportunities for learning and growth.  We have monthly outings, plus a weeklong summer camp each year.  These include camping in cold weather, the mountains, the deserts (where it may be quite hot), backpacking or at the beach.  The Scouts chose a weeklong Summer Camp from a variety of Scout camps in California. Our goal is to provide a well-rounded experience for the Scouts in a variety of environments. Please see our Calendar for our current planned events. 
- Advancement & Learning:   We do advancement at every meeting and on every outing.  We will not force a Scout to earn advancement but we will make available every opportunity for him to achieve these.   We typically have an annual advancement day in a local park to focus on advancement activities for the Scouts. 
- Service to the Community:  We provide multiple opportunities for the Scouts to perform service to the Huntington Beach and Orange County community.  These range from supporting community organizations as a volunteer at special events, to service projects for local schools and community organizations, and to support to our sponsoring organization.   
- We also maintain a Troop Web site at www.troop227.org which includes pictures of recent scouting activities and a calendar of upcoming events
